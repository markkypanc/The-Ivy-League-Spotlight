The Ivy League Spotlight (IvySpot)
Many students have a really difficult time to find the suitable college to get in. Since a numerous number of students in high school do not know much about the world class colleges that much, sometimes their parents can not suggest it through their experiences and knowledges. The core features of this window app will give you the list of world’s top rank university to surf. Initially, you will see the whole map as a default screen. It has the ability to search a specific continent with specific place from a searching box as well. Immediately, after pushing search button it will relocated to the college you’d like to find. The best thing to get the admission details is to go to the university’s website. So, the website linking button are made up. Ultimately, all the datas will be on your hand to make an admission consideration among them. I would like to be the one that can actually use this project in the real world with a developed program by time to help people out of not knowing where to go for college degree. This leads to the existence of The Ivy League Spotlight; aka IvySpot
